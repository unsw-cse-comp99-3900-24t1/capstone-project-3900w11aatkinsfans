taught or read about is highly inaccurate although this is not a simple process basically it all boils down to simplicity and how energy responds and interacts with itself there are higher and lower forms of vibrating energy creating things that feel good and things that do not so then there is no meaning to anything meaning is simply what we choose to place on any particular manifestation some things may feel good to one person according to how they interpret them and may feel very unpleasant to another a rule of thumb then might be that things either feel good or they feel bad it's that simple as we begin to vibrate higher and higher we become less and less of a match to what has been created so far on this planet and also to any lower vibrating aspects of other human behaviors and realities one might think that as we become more spiritual we embody a great compassion understanding and tolerance at higher levels than we ever have before but this is not the case as we progress through ascension and begin to vibrate higher and higher we find ourselves becoming highly intolerant of any lower vibrating energies we simply cannot be in their presence for very long and we may even become angry and frustrated with them as well there is a method to this madness as mentioned in earlier sections of this book there is a hierarchy to energetic levels and dimensions when we reach higher realities it is very difficult to reside or spend time in the lower realities we are simply not a match to them anymore this response also has other benefits the intolerance greatly encourages us to create more on the outside that matches how we are vibrating feeling and being on the inside if our outside reality feels downright awful we will most assuredly be inspired to save ourselves through our need to feel better by creating higher ways of living and being and by not tolerating and refusing to be a part of the old reality as we literally cannot stomach it anymore it makes us literally refuse to participate therefore withdrawing any energy of support if we do not become involved in something and negate it it cannot survive because there is no energy to make it real and alive it will simply cease to be as it will not be residing in anyone's consciousness through this intolerance we are also being very direct as we progress into higher vibrating human beings we find that we can no longer beat around the bush sit by and watch or take a long winding road to get anywhere higher energy moves in a straight shot it does not go here and there make excuses and support friends and family even though they are in unhealthy situations or sit blindly by it is simple and direct no wishy washy uncertainty and passivity the time is up for tolerating the old and for waiting it's the higher way or no way at some level we know this and at times can find ourselves addressing the lower vibrations very directly in this way this is a higher form of love it involves an inability to support the lower vibrations in anything we are actually being supportive and loving in that we are now supporting the highest ways through this intolerance we are actually being spiritual warriors of higher truth and greatly helping others in the higher realms we create through a partnership with source and as we are becoming more and more of source ourselves we must connect much more deeply now in order to create the higher ways during these years of ascension it can appear that we are getting absolutely nowhere it may seem that nothing ever goes our way or that we are receiving very little support for getting what we want this is really not the case we do not want to create things that are not of a higher vibration or that will no longer fit in the near future in other ways we cannot create from ego in the higher realms when we are not getting what we want it is usually because we won't be in that situation or reality very soon or that we are not yet ready if there is something that you really feel you must have then you are not ready to receive it it is ironic that we always get what we want when we no longer want it what is happening here is that we have lost our attachment which places us in a position for perfect creating in addition we are not then creating from our ego this is all part of the ascension process through it all we can get pretty discouraged at times when we get discouraged and let down over and over again and feel that all our dreams have shattered we become apathetic this is perfect it puts us into a space of letting go we simply do not care anymore this makes us let go and release the energy of attachment we are then residing in neutral energy with no agendas and this allows much more of source to enter and of course allows us to let go of many of the illusions",
