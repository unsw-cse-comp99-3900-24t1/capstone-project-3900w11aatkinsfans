            "phrase": "in her second novel langan delivers a powerhouse creepfest that recalls in the best way possible the early work of stephen king corpus christi maine was once a town of affluence but since the mysterious paper mill fire in the neighboring town of bedford depicted in last year's well-received debut the keeper released dense sulfuric clouds that killed the surrounding forest corpus christi has been in steady decline when fourth-grade teacher lois larkin takes her class on a field trip to the now-abandoned bedford they're exposed to a deadly virus that transforms the infected into ravenous flesh-eating monsters rather than stick to zombie lit convention mindless undead endless chases langan invests her plague with a sinister intelligence of unknown origin maintaining a skin-crawling tension as the vivid cast of characters succumb to murderous insanity hunting down and tearing apart animals neighbors and loved ones langan has the control of a pro parsing just enough horrific details to allow the truly gruesome scenes to play out unbound in the imagination this solid sophomore effort proves that the keeper s disturbing ability to burrow into readers heads and stay there was no fluke",
