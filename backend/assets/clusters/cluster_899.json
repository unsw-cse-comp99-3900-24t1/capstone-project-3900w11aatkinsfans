            "phrase": "this first section contains the days of creation this is the only section which due to it being the first does not start with the generations of showing that the world was not generated but was made in an act of creation having established that the number one represents god and his sovereign nature let us follow the thread further into prime numbers numbers which have no other known significance in themselves and are prime numbers divisible only by themselves and one are also stamped with this theme of god first jesus first recorded words properly put into perspective his highest priority and also what ours should be and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that i must be about my father's business this is especially relevant when his last words are remembered it is finished also of note is jesus first words in his ministry after he was baptized by full immersion by john the baptist in the river jordan he received the holy spirit he then went and prayed and fasted in the wilderness for 40 days at the end of that time he was tempted by the devil his responses to satan at that time are the first words he spoke in his ministry thus jesus not only used the word of god the resist the devil but also showed that the first place any ministry should start is with gods word when the angels sang to the shepherds to announce the birth of jesus they sang first they sang glory to god before good will toward all men in all of these first words god is given priority hear o israel the lord thy god is one lord it does not deny the trinity but it absolutely excludes the possibility of another lord it excludes therefore all idolatry interestingly the term one lord occurs only five times in the bible firstly in deuteronomy as mentioned above and the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day shall there be and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him one lord one faith one baptism the sum of the verse numbers that these occur in is 4 9 29 6 5 53 which is a prime number which representsm potential children of god the sum of the chapter numbers in which these occur is 6 14 12 8 4 44 which is divisible by 11 a prime number which represents revelation one god also has similar numeric features it occurs seven times in the bible have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the covenant of our fathers and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is seeing it is one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus 19 thou believest that there is one god the same value we saw earlier in the sum of the chapter values for the term one lord it can be seen that the two different words sum to 13 and 31 respectively a nice pattern in itself also the digits of the sum of each word sum to four almost a preview of the total sum being 44 this is the exact same number that we saw for the sum of the chapter numbers of table gt this is a prime number just like the the sum of the verse value for the occurence of the phrase one lord this phrase is stamped with the significance of prime numbers and the meaning of one the first occurrence of the word one in the bible is in the phrase one place which has a numeric value of 199 a prime with no other known significance and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so the hebrew word ra-ah meaning to tend a flock to pasture it to associate with as a friend or often shepherd this word is used in the most famous of psalms psalm 23 this word occurs in the bible 173 times in 144 verses 173 is a prime number with no other known significance thus god puts his seal on it as indeed the lord is my shepherd friend does sum up our relationship with him it is also of interest to note that the 144 verses in which it is found is 12 times 12 this number is also used symbolically in revelation of the lords perfect government so this word shepherd friend is also associated with gods perfect kingdom to come any perfect government must entail a relationship between the ruler god and his people in which the peoples best interests are sought ie they are shepherded but also there must be love friendship so not only does this word sum up our relationship with god but also the qualities which are required in a perfect government words that only occur once in the bible are especially stamped with gods sovereign authority and power such words can be especially instructive for example he that is our god is the god of salvation and unto god the lord belong the issues from death of salvation is the hebrew word moh-shah-oth which is only used this once so god puts his especial stamp on it for salvation is from god and none other we cannot earn it or achieve it ourselves no statues of wood stone metal or any other material can give it to us no philosophy or belief can win it for us only god hs wbt teb-oo-saw which means destruction is only used once and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram for when he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab this single use of this word speaks of a fulfillment of the purpose of god the house of ahab kings of the northern nation of israel had been very wicked in idolatry and leading the nation to worship false gods thus after prolonged warning from several prophets god removes them from ruling the nation and brings punishment upon the house however ahaziah was the king of the southern nation of judah at this time he and his family that went with him was slain because they were with the evil house of ahab when judgment fell galatians 3 24 tells us that the old testament is to teach us the lesson that we should not keep company with bad influences could not be clearer d b a ob-dawn which also means destruction is only used once 6 for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred 7 then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews in this instance queen esther is pleading with the king for her people this passage also shows the completion of gods purpose haman the enemy of the jews was completely defeated and the things he had planned for the jews was done to him by using this word only once the great emphasis is placed upon he who wrought this salvation god for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart kritiko",
