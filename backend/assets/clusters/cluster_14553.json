at all margerrison you're convinced we're not alone in the universe mitchell oh i know for sure we're not alone in the universe now have we been able to identify for sure where the other inhabited planets are no we haven't certainly not in our solar system but they have identified quite a number of planets now that very likely could be life-bearing planets i happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and the ufo phenomenon is real although it has been covered up by our governments for quite a long time margerrison whoa well hang on a minute this is big all this is quite a shock to me mitchell well i'm sorry you haven't been reading the papers recently it's starting to open up quite a bit margerrison so you're telling me there's a lot of information here to take on board hang on a minute listen i've heard crazy ufo nuts tell me this kind of thing before i've never had dr ed mitchell the sixth man to walk on the moon a respected scientist in his own right announce to me that we've been visited by aliens from other planets and that they definitely are out there there is no debating it mitchell well this is the first time you've ever talked to me or i would have told you about it before margerrison laughs so you believe the whole deal mitchell there's more nonsense out there about this than there is real knowledge but it is a real phenomenon and there are a few of us who know it's been covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so but slowly it's leaked out and some of us are privileged to have been briefed on some of it i happen to have grown up in roswell new mexico where presumably the roswell incident of 1947 took place and i'm quite knowledgeable about it there since i grew up there but i've also been in military circles and intelligence circles that know below the surface of what has been public knowledge that yes we have been visited margerrison and you're serious you're not going to go i was just pulling your leg about that that it's not true i'm wondering if i've stumbled upon astronaut humor and in a couple of minutes you're going to go i was only pulling your leg margerrison wow so you've been briefed on the fact that we've been visited mitchell well briefed is one word for it i have been involved in much of this work it's not my main work it's not my main interest but i've been deeply involved in certain committees and research programs with very credible scientists and various intelligence people that do know the real inside story and i am not hesitant to talk about it margerrison what is the real inside story mitchell that's what i'm telling you we have been visited margerrison is it regular contact or one crash or mitchell well no there is quite a bit of contact going on i can't tell you because i don't know all the extent of it not all of the inside details because that is not my really main interest but the fact that we have been visited that the july 1947 roswell crash is real and a number of other contacts have been real and ongoing is pretty well known to those of us who have been briefed and been close to the subject matter margerrison so why is it being covered up then why is it not mainstream mitchell the reason for that goes back to when the main instances started taking place after world war ii when in the united states at least i can't speak for the european governments or south american governments all of them recently have started opening their files this has started to open up and the internet or look at some of the international press you'll start to get the stories that are coming out now margerrison but i've had people on the show telling me that governments are mounting towards disclosure towards saying this is the case do you think it will be the case that there will be an actual disclosure on this maybe this year that the governments mitchell i don't know whether it will be this year in the united states but certainly we've already had it in the last few years from the belgium government from the french government from the brazilian government the mexican government they've opened their ufo files and admitted they had the files margerrison ok let me get my head together listen here's what i know i've had people on the show talking about the fact that the catholic church has said that belief in life on other planets does not compromise your catholicism mitchell of course that just happened recently in association i believe with a major release from the british government of some of the british files they were not your deepest files but they were some files released margerrison what's happening over the next four years all of the ufo files here in the u k are being released do you think it's the case that we are ramping up to maybe the u k admitting mitchell i can't say how fast it's going to happen but certainly the public awareness of it is increasing the public acceptance is increasing the amount of misinformation covert and actual attempts to cover up seem to be decreasing i think we're headed for real disclosure by some serious organizations moving in that direction margerrison you've had a long time to think about this what do you think the impact will be on the world when it is finally mainstream news that there are alien beings from outside this planet mitchell well i think at this point it's probably a whole bunch of what's new i think that certainly in the united states that well over 70 of the people now accept this as fact while they do not know all the correct story they do know there has been or accept the fact that there has been visitation and see ufos in the skies all the time that are very likely alien craft now not all of them aerial craft are i suspect that some of them are homegrown i suspect that in the past sixty years or so that there has been some back-engineering of e t technologies and the creation of this type of equipment but it's not nearly as sophisticated yet as what the visitors have margerrison so as part of your knowing about all this and also going public with it do you worry about your safety with this kind of stuff or mitchell oh i think those days are gone that used to be a concern among the people on the inside but i don't think they are knocking anybody off for talking any more or doing drastic things to them margerrison what do you think the intent of the aliens is is it hostile or peaceful not at all it's not hostile it's pretty obvious that if it were hostile we would have been gone by now mitchell we could have been gone by now margerrison wow mitchell we would have no defense if that's what their real intent was margerrison are we talking what do they look like mitchell you've seen some of the pictures the pictures that i know of some of them are these little people that look strange to us as far as i know from my professional contacts that have had contact that's pretty accurate margerrison do you think other people who were involved with the moon landings know about this mitchell some of them do but again like other people if you are interested enough to dig into it and want to know about it you can know about it cell phone musical sound margerrison listen i know you are a busy guy and i hear your phone mitchell yes people don't leave me alone the phone is ringing all the time and i'm here by myself margerrison this is easily one of the most significant conversations of my life unbelievable i want to thank you for joining us"
