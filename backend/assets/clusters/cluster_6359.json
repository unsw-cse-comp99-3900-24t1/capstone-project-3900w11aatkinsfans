            "phrase": "these new clips demonstrate the original mock-up but with aluminium sleeves on the rollers which increases the electron flow and the magnetic effect such that with just an exciter voltage of 1 5 volts we are able to spin the rollers at 200 rpm without them flying off the ring in the first new video you will notice that once the rollers are up to speed they run at equal distance from each other the demonstration shows the gradual application of the 1 5 volts and then the gradual reduction to 0 volts in the second video one potential new investor is examining the demonstration",
