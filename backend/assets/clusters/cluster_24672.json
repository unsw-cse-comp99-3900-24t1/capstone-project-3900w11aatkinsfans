            "phrase": "through our review of pediatric adverse events we found a 1 55 risk of adverse events occurring in 100 treatments of acupuncture that coincides with the low risk detailed in the studies mentioned previously according to the researchers the actual risk to an individual patient is hard to determine because certain patients such as an immunosuppressed patient can be predisposed to an increased risk acupuncturist s qualifications differ and practices vary in certain parts of the world nevertheless it seems acupuncture is a safe complementary alternative medicine modality for pediatric patients on the basis of the data we reviewed on efficacy from all the conditions reviewed the most extensive research has looked into acupuncture s role in managing postoperative and chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting postoperatively there is far more evidence of acupuncture s efficacy for pediatrics than for children treated with chemotherapy acupuncture seems to be most effective in preventing postoperative induced nausea in children for adults research shows that acupuncture can inhibit chemotherapy-related acute vomiting but conclusions about its effects in pediatrics cannot be made on the basis of the available published clinical trials data to date pain has yielded the most convincing results on acupuncture efficacy musculoskeletal and cancer-related pain commonly affects children and adults but unfortunately mostly adult studies have been conducted thus far because the manifestations of pain can be different in children than in adults data cannot be extrapolated from adult research systematic reviews have shown that existing data often lack adequate control groups and sample sizes we could not find any well-conducted randomized controlled studies that looked at pediatrics and acupuncture exclusively admit the researchers also research so far cannot conclude the usefulness of acupuncture on seasonal allergic rhinitis children afflicted with nocturnal enuresis asthma other neurologic conditions gastrointestinal disorders and addiction acupuncture has been used therapeutically in china for thousands of years and is growing in

work by blocking the action of a certain enzyme chemical in the liver which is needed to make cholesterol statins which control the first step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol have been shown to in rodents both in vitro and in vivo the effect is associated with an increased expression of the bone morphogenetic protein-2 bmp-2 gene in bone cells one of the most critical components of building healing and remodeling bone in humans is a process called osteoinduction bone morphogenetic proteins bmps found in human blood and bones are a group of growth factors and cytokines known for their ability to induce the formation of bone and cartilage bmps have been used to stimulate the production of bone in animals and humans with great success fda has approved the use of bmps for anterior spinal fusion in the lumbar spine and many other clinical trials have found these proteins to be effective in generating bone in other areas of the spine the spine research community is encouraged by bmps and hopes they may someday be the standard for fusion procedures reducing postsurgical pain and improve the effectiveness of spinal surgeries present study done at the university of hong kong rabbits with bone defects created to their parietal bones were grafted with collagen matrix mixed with red yeast rice extract in the control animal two defects were grafted with collagen matrix alone in the control group cells were cultured for three durations 24 hours 48 hours and 72 hours without any intervention in the red yeast rice group cells were cultured for the same durations with various concentrations of red yeast rice extract total protein mitochondrial activity and bone cell formation were measured as a result the test animal showed more formation of new bone in the defects than the control animal the bone formation in bone defects on the animals and increased bone cell formation in vitro the researchers explained that red yeast rice contains monacolins which are a family of hmg-coa reductase inhibitors moreover monacolin k is equivalent to the statin known as mevinolin or lovastatin it is the function of the red yeast rice include sterols sitosterol campesterol stigmasterol sapogenin isoflavones and monounsaturated fatty acids red yeast rice is a natural product with potential in treating bone defects and probably also http feeds feedburner com r

research by scientists at england s university of cambridge and ucla suggests their findings appear june 6 in the peer-reviewed journal science serotonin has long been associated with social behavior and low levels of anxiety but its precise involvement in impulsive aggression has been controversial though many scientists have hypothesized a link between serotonin and impulsivity this is one of the first studies to show a causal link between the two the findings highlight why some of us may become combative or aggressive when we have not eaten the essential amino acid necessary for the body to create serotonin levels naturally decline when we don t eat the research also provides insight into clinical disorders characterized by low serotonin levels such as depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder and may help explain some of the social difficulties associated with these disorders ucla scientists reported in april that the human brain responds to being treated fairly the same way it responds to winning money and eating chocolate being treated fairly turns on the brain s reward circuitry in the new science study they and their cambridge colleagues report that people with low serotonin levels were found to be more sensitive to being treated unfairly the science study involved 20 subjects 14 of them female with an average age of 25 as in the april study published in the journal psychological science participants were presented with fair and insulting offers for dividing sums of money if they declined neither they nor the person making the offer would receive anything some of the offers were fair such as receiving 5 brisith pounds out of 10 or out of 12 while others were unfair such as receiving 5 pounds out of 23 in this study however after initially responding to the offers participants were given a drink that significantly reduced their serotonin levels they were then presented with the offers again serotonin levels were reduced they rejected 82 of the unfair offers when their serotonin levels were normal they rejected only 67 of the unfair offers thus people with low serotonin levels were more likely to reject unfair offers the same person may experience the same thing as fair and unfair on different days based on how the neurochemistry of the brain is functioning said study co-author matthew d lieberman ucla associate professor of psychology and a founder of social cognitive neuroscience when we feel something is unfair that may have to do with how our brain causes us to experience the world our subjects are not aware their serotonin levels are affecting the way they experience the world this suggests we should be more forgiving of other people s perspectives a sense of fair play is not a purely rational process he added it seems not to be the case that like a math formula if something is fair it s fair for all time in all situations chinese medicine news 66 150 96 121 chinese medicine news by chinese

medicine service at mskcc dr pfister presented the findings at the annual meeting of the american society for clinical oncology neck dissection is a common procedure for treatment of head and neck cancer there are different types of neck dissection which vary based on which structures are removed and the anticipated side effects one type the radical neck dissection involves complete removal of lymph nodes from one side of the neck the muscle that helps turn the head a major vein and a nerve that is critical to full range of motion for the arm and shoulder pain and shoulder mobility problems are common after such surgery adversely affecting quality of life as well as employability for certain occupations said dr pfister nerve-sparing and other modified radical techniques that preserve certain structures without compromising disease control reduce the incidence of these problems but do not eliminate them entirely dr pfister adds unfortunately available conventional methods of treatment for pain and dysfunction following neck surgery often have limited benefits leaving much room for improvement seventy patients participated in the study and were randomized to receive either acupuncture or usual care which includes recommendations of physical therapy exercises and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs for all of the patients at least three months had elapsed since their surgery and radiation treatments the treatment group received four sessions of acupuncture over the course of approximately four weeks both groups were evaluated using the constant-murley scale a composite measure of pain and mobility improved in 39 of the patients receiving acupuncture compared to a 7 improvement in the group that received usual care an added benefit of acupuncture was significant reduction of reported xerostomia or extreme dry mouth this distressing problem common among cancer patients following radiotherapy in the head and neck is addressed with only limited success by mainstream means acupuncture does not work for everyone but it can be extraordinarily helpful for many said dr cassileth it does not treat illness but acupuncture can control a number of distressing symptoms such as shortness of breath acupuncture offered good analgesic effects for patients of late acupuncture at 3-5 of the most severe tender points and a medication group treated with oral administration according to the who three step administration principle i e the patients with mild pain took morphine the results showed that both methods could effectively control acupuncture group was significantly better than 87 5 in the medication group the researchers concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture treatment is better than that of the three step administration with

risk by up to 45 according to a review of major scientific data experts recommend dosage of 500mg a day for healthy persons and 1 g for patients with coronary artery diseases cardiovascular benefit docosahexaenoic acid dha and eicosapentaenoic acid epa are found in fish oils the best source for dha and epa are fatty coldwater fish such as herring mackerel salmon and tuna fish oil supplements or algae supplements also can provide omega-3 fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids they are essential to human health but cannot be manufactured by the body for this reason omega-3 fatty acids can be found in fish such as salmon tuna and halibut other marine life such as algae and krill certain plants including purslane and nut oils omega-3 fatty acids play a crucial role in brain function as well as normal growth and development the american heart association recommends eating fish particularly fatty fish such as mackerel lake trout herring sardines albacore tuna and salmon at least 2 times a week there are three major types of omega 3 fatty acids that are ingested in foods and used by the body alpha-linolenic acid ala eicosapentaenoic acid epa and docosahexaenoic acid dha once eaten the body converts ala to epa and dha the two types of omega-3 fatty acids more readily used by the body extensive research indicates that omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation and help prevent risk factors associated with chronic diseases such as arthritis these essential fatty acids are highly concentrated in the brain and appear to be particularly important for cognitive brain memory and performance and behavioural function in fact infants who do not get enough omega-3 fatty acids from their mothers during pregnancy are at risk for developing vision and nerve problems symptoms of fatty acid deficiency include extreme tiredness fatigue poor memory dry skin depression and poor circulation thousands of research studies have documented how the oils known as cardiovascular system particularly among people diagnosed with coronary artery disease the incredible volume of research on this topic creates difficulty for many physicians and patients to stay current with findings and recommendations related to these oils cardiovascular health focusing on who benefits most from their protective effects recommended guidelines for administration and dosing and possible adverse effects associated with their use author james o'keefe m d a cardiologist from the mid america heart institute in kansas city mo cites the results of several large trials that demonstrated the positive benefits associated with omega-3 fatty acids either from oily fish or fish oil capsules omega-3 fatty acids comes from three large controlled trials of 32 000 participants randomized to receive fatty acid supplements containing dha and epa or to act as controls",
